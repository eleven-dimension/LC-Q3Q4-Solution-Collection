After a year-long hiatus, I returned to the LeetCode weekly contests. Although my performance was good in the first contest, I failed to achieve a perfect score (all killed) in the last two contests. During this prolonged period, the lack of ideas for Q3 and Q4 was agonizing. I'd rather spend an hour on edging than feel imprisoned by the weekly contests. 

Therefore, I decided to work on problems with a difficulty rating above 1900 (a year ago, my ELO was around 1950, but now with more participants and a decline in my performance, the 1900 level is more appropriate). This collection includes my solutions, compiled for easy review, along with brief notes on my experience solving these problems. If I find the time and come across interesting problems, I might also add detailed explanations. I hope to one day fulfill my long-standing desire to earn the Guardian medal.
